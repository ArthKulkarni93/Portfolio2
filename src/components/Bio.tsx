            20, Sangli | Backend Developer

            I'm a developer who prefers working with systems, logic, and clean backends. 
            I believe in minimalism, both in design and in thinking, and I'm continuously 
            learning to stay relevant with evolving technologies. I focus on what works, 
            what lasts, and what makes sense.
